README - pygi branch
--------------------

This branch is focused on 'pygtk to pygi' migration.
Most of this work was done by Javier Hern√°ndez, and he's driving the accerciser's
migration process. Feel free to ask him for reporting bugs, contributing code, etc by 
irc (jhernandez at GIMPNet/freenode) or by email (jhernandez@emergya.es) ;)

At this moment, we have known issues but the code is almost stable.
