================
v0.1.0 (Stretch)
================

Accerciser lets you test all aspects of accessibility on the GNOME desktop.
Accerciser uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing you to check if
an application is providing correct information to assistive technologies and
automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a simple plugin framework which you
can use to extend and customize the accessibility information displayed.
  
Accerciser is written in Python and uses the pyLinAcc component from LSR to
interact with AT-SPI using pyORBit. In essence, it is a next generation at-poke
tool.

Features
========

* ORBit, not cspi, based

Like the modern LSR and Orca screen readers, Accerciser uses pyORBit to talk
AT-SPI with other applications. The legacy cspi module is avoided.

* Plugin architecture

Create a Python module, drop it in a folder, and have it load as a plugin pane
with full access to AT-SPI and the selected element in the accessibility tree
view.

* Interface browser and event monitor plugins

All the features you've come to expect from a poke tool, and then some.

* IPython console plugin

A full, interactive Python shell with access to the accessible object selected
in the tree view; all AT-SPI interfaces, methods and attributes; and any other
Python modules. Supports autocompletion and a million other niceties thanks to
IPython.

* API browser plugin
  
Shows the interfaces, methods, and attributes available on the selected
accessible object.

* Global hotkeys

Move the tree view quickly to the last focused accessible or the one under the
mouse pointer. Insert a marker into the event monitor log for easy
identification at a later time.

* Customizable UI layout

Move plugin tabs to different panels or even separate windows to view them
concurrently.

* Accessibility!

Accerciser does not disable its own accessibility.

* Yelp documentation
  
Included in the package.

* Python powered

Brits, not serpents.
