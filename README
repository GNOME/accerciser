Accerciser
Just 15 minutes a day for better accessibility!

Description
===========

  Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the GNOME
  desktop. It uses AT-SPI to inspect and control widgets, allowing you to check
  if an application is providing correct information to assistive technologies
  and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a simple plugin framework which
  you can use to create custom views of accessibility information.

  In essence, Accerciser is a next generation at-poke tool.
