Accerciser 3.38.0
Just 15 minutes a day for better accessibility!

Description
===========

  Accerciser is an interactive Python accessibility explorer for the GNOME
  desktop. It uses AT-SPI2 to inspect and control widgets, allowing you to check
  if an application is providing correct information to assistive technologies
  and automated test frameworks. Accerciser has a simple plugin framework which
  you can use to create custom views of accessibility information.

  In essence, Accerciser is a next generation at-poke tool.

Features
========

* Based in at-spi2

Accerciser uses the new dbus-based accessiblity framework.

* Plugin architecture

Create a Python module, drop it in a folder, and have it load as a plugin pane
with full access to AT-SPI2 and the selected element in the accessibility tree
view.

* Interface browser and event monitor plugins

All the features you've come to expect from a poke tool, and then some.

* IPython console plugin

A full, interactive Python shell with access to the accessible object selected
in the tree view; all AT-SPI2 interfaces, methods and attributes; and any other
Python modules. Supports autocompletion and a million other niceties thanks to
IPython.

* API browser plugin
  
Shows the interfaces, methods, and attributes available on the selected
accessible object.

* Global hotkeys

Move the tree view quickly to the last focused accessible or the one under the
mouse pointer. Insert a marker into the event monitor log for easy
identification at a later time.

* Customizable UI layout

Move plugin tabs to different panels or even separate windows to view them
concurrently.

* Accessibility!

Accerciser does not disable its own accessibility.

* Yelp documentation
  
Included in the package.

* Python powered

Brits, not serpents.
