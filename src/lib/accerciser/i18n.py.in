'''
Provides support for internationalization using the Python gettext
module. Configures gettext to use the translation associated with the locale
set by the user's environment at runtime. If no appropriate translation is
found, the default language is used: the one in which the strings in the
code are written (i.e. English).

The gettext function in the gettext module is alised as _ to match the name of
the equivalent C function provided by GNU gettext tools.

See the Python documentation on the gettext module at
U{http://docs.python.org/lib/module-gettext.html}. A brief tutorial on
i18n and Python is available at
U{http://www.async.com.br/faq/pygtk/index.py?req=show&file=faq22.002.htp}

  the result to a global variable _ to use the GNU translation system without
  affecting how other components of LSR are translated.
