  <title>Application Tree View</title>

  <p>
    <app>Accerciser</app>'s interface contains a tree view, namely Application Tree View, that covers all
    accessible applications currently running on the desktop. To create this tree view, <app>Accerciser</app>  
    uses the AT-SPI's registry daemon. This daemon is responsible for keeping track of all the accessible 
    applications on the desktop and forwarding X events over the AT-SPI D-Bus. After getting all accessible
    applications, <app>Accerciser</app> represents each one of them as a hierarchical structure with expanding
    nodes.

  <p>
    The first node of each application represented in this tree view is the application itself. When you expand a node, you
    can see all of its child widgets, which allows a hierarchical view of the application's interface. For each node, 
    <app>Accerciser</app> provides some basic information, such as its name, role and number of children. 
  </p>

  <note style="caution">
    <p>
      Be aware that nodes with many children take a long time to expand.

    <title>Bookmarking items in the Application Tree View</title>
    <p>
      <app>Accerciser</app> allows bookmarking items in the Application Tree View for later examining. This is helpful when
      the target application must be restarted - after rebuilding it, for example. To bookmark an item, select it and do
      <guiseq><gui>Bookmarks</gui><gui>Add Bookmark</gui></guiseq> or press <key>Ctrl</key>+<key>d</key>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bookmarks to accessible items in <app>Accerciser</app> are defined by an application name and a "path" in the
      application's internal accessible hierarchy to the bookmarked accessible. When the target application is in a
      different state - i.e. multiple top level frames -, the path might not be correct. Bookmarks could be managed
      by accessing the bookmark editing dialog through <guiseq><gui>Bookmarks</gui><gui>Edit Bookmarks</gui></guiseq>.
