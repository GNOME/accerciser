2008-06-05  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* macaroon/playback/keypress_actions.py (TypeAction._charType): 
	  Query the default keymap for the proper keycode and level. If
	  the level is 1, press shift.

	* macaroon/playback/keypress_actions.py (TypeAction._charType): 
	  Press "shift" if the character is uppercase, I don't know if
	  this is a very localizable solution, but what the hell.

	* macaroon/playback/utils.py: Added a keyval to key code function.
	* macaroon/playback/keypress_actions.py: Removed all KEY_SYM

	treated as a regular expression (bug #529442).

	* macaroon/playback/wait_actions.py (WaitForWindowActivate): If
	the active frame's name changes, check to see if it is the right frame.

2007-09-19  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* macaroon/playback/wait_actions.py (WaitAction.__str__): Fixed
	TypeError, thanks Willie Walker!

	key_code arguments optional in key press and release
	classes. Useful for cross platform.
	* macaroon/record/script_factory.py: Prepend contextual waitfors
	when a keypress comes out of the blue. Got rid of silly whitespaces.
	* macaroon/record/main.py: Put Level 2 as default. Toggle focus
	waiting. Attempt to predict consumed WM hotkeys.
	
2007-08-30  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* macaroon/playback/keypress_mimic.py, 
	macaroon/playback/playback_sequence.py: add event, acc_name,
	acc_path, and acc_role parameters to WaitAction and extend
	its onEventMethod to check these.  Modify WaitForWindowActivate
	and WaitForFocus classes to use the new WaitAction superclass.

2007-07-30  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	Gave it a default of 50ms.
	
	* macaroon/playback/Makefile.am: Added utils.py.
	* macaroon/playback/keypress_mimic.py: Look for pre-existing
	active window before waiting.
	* macaroon/playback/playback_sequence.py: Small refactor to allow
	wait actions to override current state check.
	* macaroon/playback/utils.py: Function for finding active window.
	* macaroon/record/script_factory.py: Silly exception for
	<Shift>Tab in sequnce level 2 recording.

2007-07-30  Willie Walker  <william.walker@sun.com>

        * macaraoon/playback/keypress_mimic.py: add "interval" parameter
        to TypeAction constructor and then use it in _doType as a means
        to allow overriding of keystroke_interval.

2007-07-29  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* macaroon/playback/keypress_mimic.py: Added English strings to
	represent each action.

	emits a signal on each complete step.
	* macaroon/record/main.py: Added progress bar with useful
	messages on script playback.
	* macaroon/record/script_factory.py: Key names are now in the
	actual constructor for key press and release actions.

2007-07-27  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* macaroon/playback/keypress_mimic.py: Added smarter sequence
	steps for key combos and string typing.
	* macaroon/playback/playback_sequence.py: Sequence steps now
	inform the sequence object that they finished with a signal. Added
	event caching in the sequence class so a focus event could be
	anticipated by the sequence step before it.
	* macaroon/record/about.py: s/Accerciser/Macaroon/
	* macaroon/record/main.py: Added playback capability, not
	perfect. Added capability to switch between "level 1" and "level
	2" recording, level 1 means recording each descreet 	
	key press and release, level 2 tries to make compound steps out of
	key presses.
	* macaroon/record/script_factory.py: Added "level 2" scripts.

2007-07-27  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	in WaitForWindowActivate to 30 seconds.

2007-07-26  Willie Walker  <william.walker@sun.com>

	* macaroon/record/script_factory.py: add simple comment
	before WaitForFocus lines to give us a hint about the
	name of the object we'd like to get focus.

2007-07-26  Willie Walker  <william.walker@sun.com>

	* configure.in: uncomment out IT_PROG_INTLTOOL([0.35.0]) line
          from before and add in AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(./) line.  Seems to
	  solve the problem nicely (thanks Eitan!).  Also changed
	  Accerciser reference to Macaroon.

2007-07-26  Willie Walker  <william.walker@sun.com>

	* aclocal.m4: remove since it is autogenerated.

	* configure.in: comment out IT_PROG_INTLTOOL([0.35.0]) line
          for now to prevent autogen failures due to what appears to
          be nested autogen projects (this one and accerciser above)

2007-07-26  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Removed. This is autogenerated.
	
2007-07-26  Eitan Isaacson  <eitan@ascender.com>

	* Initial import into temporary home in accerciser on gnome.org's SVN.
