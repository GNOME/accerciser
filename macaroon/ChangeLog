	* configure.in: uncomment out IT_PROG_INTLTOOL([0.35.0]) line
          from before and add in AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(./) line.  Seems to
	  solve the problem nicely (thanks Eitan!).  Also changed
	  Accerciser reference to Macaroon.

	* aclocal.m4: remove since it is autogenerated.

	* configure.in: comment out IT_PROG_INTLTOOL([0.35.0]) line
          for now to prevent autogen failures due to what appears to
          be nested autogen projects (this one and accerciser above)

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Removed. This is autogenerated.
